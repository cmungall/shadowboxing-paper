	We outline an approach which allows them to be combined together,
	and provide examples of its application in biomedicine.},

  abstract = {The value of any kind of data is greatly enhanced when it exists in
	a form that allows it to be integrated with other data. One approach
	to integration is through the annotation of multiple bodies of data
	using common controlled vocabularies or 'ontologies'. Unfortunately,
	the very success of this approach has led to a proliferation of ontologies,
	which itself creates obstacles to integration. The Open Biomedical
	Ontologies (OBO) consortium is pursuing a strategy to overcome this
	problem. Existing OBO ontologies, including the Gene Ontology, are
	undergoing coordinated reform, and new ontologies are being created
	on the basis of an evolving set of shared principles governing ontology
	development. The result is an expanding family of ontologies designed
	to be interoperable and logically well formed and to incorporate
	accurate representations of biological reality. We describe this
	OBO Foundry initiative and provide guidelines for those who might
	wish to become involved.},
